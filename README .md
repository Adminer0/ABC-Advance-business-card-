# PCB Business Card
designed a fully functional business card made on a PCB that’s more than just a card—it’s tech! It has a compact circuit with LEDs, maybe a small display or NFC, showing my contact info in a futuristic way. The card is sleek, durable, and eye-catching, merging hardware design with personal branding. Perfect for tech enthusiasts who want to leave an unforgettable impression.
